All-Purpose System Stacks

Installation

"com.ass.core" : "https://github.com/nguyenchithanh113/All-purposeSystemStacks.git?path=Assets/ASS/Packages/com.ass.core"

On menu bar, select ASS -> Core -> Install

Compilation error will happen since NugetFonUnity couldn't fetch required dependencies for some packages. Click on something and reimport or restart Unity should trigger that fetching
and everything will be as good as it is. (will fix in "near" future)
